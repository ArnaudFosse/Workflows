Templates application over multiple devices
===========================================

via auto-generated workflows.
   

Overview
--------

The demo workflow in this directory shows how a configuration
can be applied to multiple devices.
   
The effective device configuration is built from standard
MSA Micro-Services, which are attached to target devices
with an auto-generated Workflow.
   
The auto-generated Workflow is built using a "Workflow template"
in `WORKFLOWS/Utils/MSA_Template_Multi_Devices/`
